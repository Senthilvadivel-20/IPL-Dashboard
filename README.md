# IPL Dashboard in Django

### Outline:

**Helps with IPL Betting (but be cautious)** - IPL is a popular league and people like to bet on it. This dashboard can help analyze past data (not predict the future) to make informed decisions, but betting always carries risk.

**Provides IPL Data at a Glance** - A dashboard is a visual tool that shows important information (KPIs) quickly. This dashboard specifically focuses on IPL data.

**User-Friendly Interface** - This web-based dashboard allows users to enter a player or team name and see a summary in text or graphs.

**Comprehensiveness** -  It offers features like player/team details, comparisons, head-to-head data, rankings, and score prediction.

**Technology Stack** - Built with Python (Django framework), HTML, CSS, JavaScript libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn) and data stored in a CSV file. Visualizations are made with JavaScript.
